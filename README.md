# OCP-UPI-vSphere
Just stuff for a UPI installation on VMware

Adding action plan / to-do for a UPI installation of OCP on vSphere.

Work very much in progress.

CLUSTER-NAME is the name of the cluster. This is chosen when writing the install-config.yml file under metadata.name (it is also the name of the folder we will install OpenShift in on vSphere)

BASE-DOMAIN is the cluster base domain that you specify when you install the cluster.

IP - IP-address of the machine.

SERVER-HOSTNAME is the chosen hostname for the machine.

TO-DO NEXT:

- vSphere account
